# 👋 **Hi, I’m Celi**

A passionate Data Analyst with a strong background in engineering, advanced analytics, and project management. Throughout my career, I’ve gained expertise in analytics, project management, and organizational development. My journey with programming began at 19, fueled by a lifelong interest in computing. I’ve since enhanced my skill set with a Data Analytics certification and a specialization in Data Science, who decided to venture into the IT world as a data analyst and is training to become a data scientist.

##  👀 I’m interested 

At enriching experience and a commitment that drives our joint growth towards excellent and efficient management.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

To develop myself not only professionally but, more importantly, as a person. Professionally learning advanced data analytics techniques, focusing on machine learning and statistical methods. I'm also exploring different data visualization tools to represent complex datasets better.

## 💞️ I’m looking 

To collaborate on improvement approaches for each process and to collaborate on projects that involve data exploration, analysis, and visualization. I'm eager to contribute to projects where I can apply and enhance my skills in Python and SQL.


## 🔧 Tools and Frameworks

My toolkit includes a blend of powerful analytics tools and programming languages. I'm proficient in:

- Code Management: ETL · GitHub · Jupyter Notebook
- Data Bases: Microsoft Excel · SQL 
- Coding: Python (pandas, numpy, math, random) · DAX
- Data Visualization: Tableau · PowerBI · Python (matplotlib, seaborn)
  
These tools have been instrumental in my data analytics projects, allowing me to efficiently manage, analyze, and visualize data.

## 🚀 Favorite Data Sets or Challenges

As I dive deeper into data analytics, I'm intrigued by the wide range of data sets and the different challenges they present. I'm still figuring out which areas I connect with the most, but I'm especially focused on sharpening my skills in SQL and Python. I’m motivated by the ability to analyze data effectively and turn it into meaningful insights that can drive decisions and improvements.

### 🏗️ Water Resource Dashboard  
**Power BI** dashboard to monitor key performance indicators in a water utility company. Reduced report generation time by **80%**.

### 📈 Sales Forecasting Model  
Built a **machine learning model** in Python using XGBoost to forecast sales. Helped optimize resource allocation by **15%**.

### 🧼 Data Cleaning Automation  
Automated **Excel reports** with Python scripts. Saved over **10 hours/month** of manual work.

## 🌱 Learning Goals

My immediate learning objectives are:

- Enhance Python and SQL Skills: To deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python and SQL for more advanced data manipulation and analysis.
- Learn R: To expand my skill set with this powerful language, particularly favored in statistical analysis and data visualization.
- Master the Data Lifecycle: From data extraction and cleaning to processing, analysis, and visualization, I aim to refine my skills across all stages of the data lifecycle. I'm committed to continuous learning, staying updated with the latest trends and techniques, and diving into disruptive innovations in data science.
