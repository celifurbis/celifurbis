## 💞️ I’m looking 

To collaborate on improvement approaches for each process and to collaborate on projects that involve data exploration, analysis, and visualization. I'm eager to contribute to projects where I can apply and enhance my skills in Python and SQL.


## 🔧 Tools and Frameworks

My toolkit includes a blend of powerful analytics tools and programming languages. I'm proficient in:

- Code Management: ETL · GitHub · Jupyter Notebook
- Data Bases: Microsoft Excel · SQL 
- Coding: GitBash, Python (pandas, numpy, math, random) · DAX
